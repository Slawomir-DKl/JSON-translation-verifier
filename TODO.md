# To do in this project:

- Check the order of the keys
- Check differences of length in values 
    - simple - empty string vs real value
    - advanced - difference of value lengths with configurable threshold 
- Check if variables in values entered in {} are properly transferred to translation without translation
- Check if escape characters are properly transferred to translation
